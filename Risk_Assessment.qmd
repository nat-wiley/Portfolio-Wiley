title: "Risk Analysis for Transportation Emission Reduction Policies"
---

This project consisted of a risk analysis assessment for two hypothetical emission reduction plans for the city of Fort Collins, CO. This risk analysis quantified the amount of CO2e emissions reduced so I could show which policy plan achieved the most emissions reduced per tax dollar spent. In both hypothetical options, there was a budget of \$500,000 to cut emissions from residential transportation.

**Policy option 1:** Buy back vehicles that are trucks (not large commercial trucks), SUVs, or sedans, to have residents purchase an electric vehicle. This program is targeting older vehicles in the fleet for the buy-back program because the incentives are too low for owners to participate that have newer vehicles.

> The goal is to determine the amount of people that would participate in the buy back program from each population demographic (gender, education, age, reason for travel, vehicle type (SUV, sedan, truck).

**Policy option 2:** Small businesses are provided a \$5,000 incentive and recognition as a climate smart company to support telecommuting by employees for two or more days of the week. This would reduce the amount of vehicle trips per week.

> The goal is to see how many people and how many businesses would likely participate in the program

Results

:   The cost to reduce CO2e in both policy options were too high. The dollar amount cost per 1 tonne of emissions reduced was not worth investing \$500,000 in. It is higher than the current social cost of carbon.

### R Script to assess policy option 1

```{r eval=FALSE}

####Import data contains weekly emission REDUCTIONS because we worked in Access to see how much emission reduction we 
  ###would get if we switched people over to EVs

#ID is the ID number associated with each survey respondent 
#### size = 108 = average of quotas for all three vehicles = mean (c(125,90,111))

### ASSUMPTIONS:
#weekend emissions: multiply weekly emissions by 33%  and add that as the weekend emission
#example: to sample just SUVs instead of all cars, only have SUVs in your input table in Access (subset table to SUVs only, subset function can be done in R)
#make points in presentation about the risk and what we can get from the different programs


#Add packages
library(tidyverse)

#____________ Sample Buyback vehicles based on variable probabilities ______________

# sampling vehicles in buyback program by vehicle type probability
#### size = 108 = average of quotas for all three vehicles = mean (c(125,90,111))
#### Put the sample function within the forloop in order to do monte carlo iterations while you sample the amount of cars we can buy back with $500,000 budget
