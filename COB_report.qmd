title: "College of Business Sustainability Report"
---

This is a sustainability report I prepared during an internship for the College of Business at Colorado State University. During this internship, I conducted a greenhouse gas analysis for their fiscal year operations for 2019 and 2021 to reflect a covid19 and non-covid19 year. This sustainability report led to the formation of a green team where they are currently implementing recommendations I made for them to reduce their operational emissions.

The PDF of my report is available to view on my LinkedIn through the link below:
